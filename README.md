Spatial Recognition and Temporal Alignment (SpaRTA) Deep Learning for Land Cover Classification

Unofficial repository showcasing the SpaRTA methodology which I developed as part of my Ph.D. in Computer Science. The models and data available in this repository are strictly toy examples and the sole purpose of this repository is to simply showcase the overall methods and code architecture that I developed to support my research. Again, this is not an official repository for the research and all data and models in this repository should be treated as simple examples.
